## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
// Permission examples
PERMISSIONS = {
  BOOKS_READ: 'books:read',
  BOOKS_CREATE: 'books:create',
  MEMBERS_READ: 'members:read',
  LENDING_CHECKOUT: 'lending:checkout',
  REPORTS_READ: 'reports:read',
  // ... more permissions
}
```

### Authentication Features

## 📚 API Services

### BookService
```typescript
// Example usage
const books = await BookService.searchBooks({
  searchTerm: 'react',
  availableOnly: true,
  genre: ['Technology']
});

const book = await BookService.getBookById('book-id');
const availability = await BookService.checkAvailability('book-id');
```

### LendingService
```typescript
// Checkout process
const result = await LendingService.processCheckout({
  bookId: 'book-id',
  memberId: 'member-id'
});

// Return process
const returnResult = await LendingService.processReturn({
  transactionId: 'transaction-id',
  condition: BookCondition.GOOD
});
```
